	A powerful yet easy-to-use PHP micro-framework designed to help you build
	dynamic and robust Web applications - fast!
	 
	Condensed in a single 50KB file, F3 (as we fondly call it) gives you solid
	foundation, a mature code base, and a no-nonsense approach to writing Web
	applications. Under the hood is an easy-to-use Web development tool kit, a
	high-performance URL routing and cache engine, and support for
	multilingual applications. It's lightweight, easy-to-use, and fast. Most
	of all, it doesn't get in your way.
	 
	Whether you're a novice or an expert PHP programmer, F3 will get you up
	and running in no time. No unnecessary and painstaking installation
	procedures. No complex configuration required. No convoluted directory
	structures. There's no better time to start developing Web applications
	the easy way than right now!
	 
	Unlike other frameworks, F3 aims to be usable - not usual.
	 
	The philosophy behind the framework and its approach to software
	architecture is towards minimalism in structural components, avoiding
	application complexity and striking a balance between code elegance,
	application performance and programmer productivity.
	 
	Fat-Free Framework is free and released as open source software covered
	by the terms of the GNU Public License (GPL v3). You may not use the
	software, documentation, and samples except in compliance with the
	license. If the terms and conditions of this license are too restrictive
